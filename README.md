# Property-data-analysis

This report aims to present the summarizations and findings on the property-price data. The project was undertaken from 1st July to 15th July and this report gives a detailed summary of the findings and the patterns observed on data cleaning and data analysis tasks performed. The first task was to perform data cleaning, where we preprocess and clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved finding the types of the data, handling missing values with the help of heatmaps, encoding the categorical values to numerical ones using LabelEncoder, checking for duplicates and handling outliers by checking their skewness. The second task given was to perform exploratory data analysis. This involved analyzing the variable ‘Sale_Price’ since we believe this is the target variable to be predicted. We checked its skewness and visualized it to find its distribution using a bar graph ggplot. After this, we plotted a heatmap to identify the correlation between the target and the other features and checked the correlation between these attributes with the target variable. We also plot the six most correlated variables with the target variable and see how they are related. Python language was used to perform the data preprocessing and cleaning as well as the exploratory data analysis. Jupyter Notebook was used to write the code and visualize the results.
